<p>Hi {{advertiser_name}},</p>
<br/>
<p>Thank you for taking the time off to meet us and set up the implementation program with your agency.</p>
<br/>
<p>To make it easy for you to request tasks, we have created this unique table that will be yours to manage. This table will capture the CID and task combination that you may have.</p>
<br/>
<p>After you upload the data, save & submit, tickets will automatically be raised for all the requests. </p>
<br/>
<p>Please bookmark this link as this will be your one point summary of leads submitted. Do reply to this email if you need to know the status of ny CID you had submitted.</p>
<br/>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tag Implementation Team</p>
