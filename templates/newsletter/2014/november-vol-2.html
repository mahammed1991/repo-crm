Even if I did, I am not sure I could have successfully implemented them. &nbsp;Therefore, I am grateful to Preetha for her time and courteous nature in assisting me with this in a swift and timely manner. &nbsp;I am also grateful that she explained to me and taught me how to check my conversion rate and check on my remarketing campaign. &nbsp;After implementing these codes, I know I would not have been able to check on this step. &nbsp;Not only are these invaluable to my business, Preetha made this process less intimidating. &nbsp;I would not describe myself as a technologically savvy person. &nbsp;</p>

It also helps to ask the advertiser to let their website designer (if there is one) that they want to implement the code and that the implementation specialist will be reaching out to them.  This ensures that there is minimum pushback from the designer.
